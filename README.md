## Overview
We are building a chat app to allow students to communicate with their teacher. The teacher wants to restrict certain studentâ€™s capabilities within the app to ensure the app is for school purposes. We have been requested by our client to a chat application that is better fitted for her needs.
## Purpose
The current chat application platform that our client uses are not user friendly and/or have their limitations on what they are capabable of. Our teacher wants a single page application to enable teacher to student real-time messaging during remote instruction.
## Customer/Client
Our client is a fifth grade teacher that currently uses other chat platforms to assist during remote instruction.
